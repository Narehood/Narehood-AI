# narehood-ai

Public portable coding-agent configuration, reusable skills, and project
planning templates. **Cursor** (including Cloud Agents) is the primary target;
optional Codex install remains supported.

## Use with Cursor

Cursor loads project `AGENTS.md` automatically. Skills under `.agents/skills/`
are discovered in the repository and, when linked into `~/.agents/skills/`,
across other projects.

To install skills into your user agents home (shared with Codex):

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --dry-run
./scripts/install.sh
```

On Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -DryRun
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

The installer also manages optional Codex home files under `~/.codex/`. For
Cursor-only work, the important result is `.agents/skills/` linked into
`~/.agents/skills/`. See [docs/CURSOR_LAYOUT.md](docs/CURSOR_LAYOUT.md).

Project planning templates live under
`.agents/skills/ai-project-manager/assets/project-docs/` (`AGENTS.md`,
`SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `TASKS.md`, and optional `STATUS.md`). Adapt them to
each project; keep placeholders out of production docs.

## Optional Codex install

Preview and install on Linux or macOS:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --dry-run
./scripts/install.sh
```

On Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -DryRun
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

Restart Codex after installation. Existing managed files are backed up under
`~/.codex/backups/`. Credentials, sessions, history, caches, and plugins are
not changed by default.

The installer manages:

- `codex-home/` configuration and rules in `~/.codex/`
- `.agents/skills/` into `~/.agents/skills/`

### Trust GitHub projects

Every Codex installation renders `~/.codex/config.toml` with trusted-project
entries for that user's `~/github` directory and every Git worktree found
recursively beneath it. The committed sample `codex-home/config.toml` does not
contain personal absolute paths; the installer adds machine-local trusts at
install time.

Rerun the installer after creating or cloning repositories so new worktrees are
added. Common dependency and build directories are skipped during discovery.

### Install recommended plugins

[Codex plugin](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/plugins) installation is opt-in
because plugins can add instructions, hooks, and connections to external
services. Preview or install the repository's selected plugins on Linux or
macOS with:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --dry-run --plugins
./scripts/install.sh --plugins
```

On Windows:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1 -DryRun -Plugins
.\scripts\install.ps1 -Plugins
```

The selected plugin IDs live in `codex-plugins.txt`. The initial selection is
`superpowers@openai-curated`. Start a new Codex session after installation so
its skills become available. The managed global instructions tell Codex to
skip the full Superpowers methodology for trivial, low-risk edits.

For GitHub-heavy projects, the broader priority order is:

1. **Superpowers plugin** for planning, TDD, debugging, and delivery workflows.
2. **GitHub plugin** for pull requests, issues, reviews, and repository
   operations.
3. **Context7 MCP server** for current framework and dependency documentation.
4. **Playwright or Chrome DevTools MCP server** for frontend testing and
   browser debugging.
5. **Codex Security plugin** for vulnerability analysis and remediation.
6. **Sentry plugin** for production debugging.

Only the entries in `codex-plugins.txt` are installed by `--plugins`. Context7,
Playwright, and Chrome DevTools are
[MCP servers](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/extend/mcp) rather than plugins and
require separate configuration. GitHub, Codex Security, and Sentry remain
opt-in until they are added to the manifest because they can require service
authorization or project-specific setup.

### Install RTK

[RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) is an optional Rust CLI proxy that
compresses verbose command output before it reaches an agent's context window.
Install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk
```

Do not use `cargo install rtk`. The `rtk` package name on crates.io belongs to
a different project.

Ensure Cargo's binary directory is on `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Then verify both the binary and its output-savings command:

```bash
rtk --version
rtk gain
```

Managed agent instructions already tell agents to use RTK selectively for
commands whose large or repetitive output benefits from filtering. Short
commands and commands that require exact output remain raw.

## Use skills

Invoke a skill explicitly when needed (Codex `$skill` syntax; Cursor may also
auto-select from skill descriptions):

```text
$linux-sysadmin diagnose this service failure
$python-ai add an Ollama-backed model provider
$rust-cli add a new subcommand
```

## AI development workflow

The reusable workflow separates planning from pull-request readiness:

- `$ai-project-manager` reads or creates `AGENTS.md`, `SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`,
  `TASKS.md`, and optional `STATUS.md`, pauses at plan-approval boundaries, and
  executes one reviewable phase at a time.
- `$pr-readiness` validates the final diff, runs local CodeRabbit review,
  records manual testing, and verifies CI and review state before merge.

See [docs/WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORKFLOW.md) for the complete lifecycle.

## Local models (Codex)

Local model profiles are optional and do not change the default provider.

Ollama:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3-coder
codex --profile ollama
```

llama.cpp:

```bash
llama-server --model /path/to/model.gguf --jinja --port 8080
codex --profile llamacpp
```

Override either profile's model with `--model`:

```bash
codex --profile ollama --model another-model
codex --profile llamacpp --model another-model
```

Local models need reliable structured tool calling for effective Codex use.
The llama.cpp profile expects a Responses-compatible endpoint at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`.

## Validate

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
```

The validation includes an isolated Linux or macOS installer integration test.
GitHub Actions also exercises the PowerShell installer on Windows and runs
dependency review for pull requests.

## Repository layout

- `AGENTS.md`: instructions for maintaining this repository
- `SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `TASKS.md`: requirements, phase order, and
  validated task status
- `.agents/skills/`: reusable skills (Cursor + Codex)
- `codex-plugins.txt`: opt-in Codex plugin selections
- `codex-home/`: portable Codex global instructions, configuration, profiles,
  and rules
- `docs/`: reference documentation loaded only when explicitly requested
- `scripts/`: installation and validation

See [docs/CURSOR_LAYOUT.md](docs/CURSOR_LAYOUT.md) and
[docs/CODEX_LAYOUT.md](docs/CODEX_LAYOUT.md) for discovery and configuration
behavior.
