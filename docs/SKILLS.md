# Skills for coding agents

## Purpose

A skill is a reusable workflow with focused instructions, optional references,
and optional scripts.

Use a skill for knowledge that is:

- reused across repositories
- independent of one project's requirements
- specific enough to have a reliable trigger
- too detailed for global or repository instructions

## Discovery locations

Canonical portable locations (Cursor and Codex):

```text
repository/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Cursor also discovers `.cursor/skills/` and `~/.cursor/skills/`. Prefer
`.agents/skills/` as the source of truth in this repository so skills stay
shared. See [CURSOR_LAYOUT.md](CURSOR_LAYOUT.md).

Codex scans repository skill directories from the working directory up to the
repository root. The installer links this repository's skills into the user
location so they are available in other repositories.

## Required layout

```text
.agents/skills/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
├── agents/
│   └── openai.yaml
├── references/
└── scripts/
```

Only `SKILL.md` is required. It must start with YAML front matter containing a
clear `name` and `description`.

## Authoring rules

- Keep each skill focused on one workflow.
- Put trigger terms and boundaries in the description.
- Write imperative steps with explicit inputs, outputs, and validation.
- Load references only when the task needs them.
- Prefer instructions over scripts unless deterministic automation is useful.
- Keep project requirements in project documentation, not reusable skills.
- Use `agents/openai.yaml` only for useful UI metadata or dependencies.
- Prefer agent-agnostic trigger wording ("coding agent", "Cursor or Codex").

## Repository skills

- `ai-project-manager`
- `bash-scripting`
- `forgejo-maintainer`
- `homelab-admin`
- `hugo`
- `linux-sysadmin`
- `mdbook`
- `podman-operator`
- `pr-readiness`
- `python-ai`
- `quickshell`
- `rust-cli`

Run `./scripts/validate.sh` after adding or changing a skill. Validation fails
when this list and the skill directories drift apart.
