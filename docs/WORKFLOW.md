# AI development workflow

## Project file roles

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Durable instructions the coding agent loads automatically |
| `SPEC.md` | Product and technical requirements and acceptance criteria |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Ordered outcomes, dependencies, risks, and exit criteria |
| `TASKS.md` | Current actionable work and validated status |
| `STATUS.md` | Optional living shipped / blocked / deploy / secrets-location notes |
| `.agents/skills/` | Reusable workflows Cursor and Codex can invoke |
| `docs/` | Reference material loaded only when requested or linked |

## Complete lifecycle

1. Install or link this repository's reusable skills (and optional Codex home
   files). Prefer project `AGENTS.md` for Cursor.
2. Inspect the real repository, branch, worktree, architecture, runtime paths,
   and existing validation.
3. Put durable project conventions and boundaries in `AGENTS.md`, including
   PR-by-default and blocked-by-keys rules.
4. Define observable requirements, non-goals, and acceptance criteria in
   `SPEC.md`.
5. Order outcomes, risks, exit criteria, and validation in `ROADMAP.md`.
6. Break the current phase into reviewable work in `TASKS.md`.
7. Maintain `STATUS.md` when the project needs an operational shipped/blocked
   picture separate from tasks. Use placeholders only in public repositories.
8. Use `$ai-project-manager` to produce a requirement-linked plan with automated
   and manual validation.
9. Stop for plan approval when the user reserved that checkpoint.
10. Implement one approved phase, run focused checks, and inspect the diff.
11. Run the complete local gate and update task status only after it passes.
12. Use `$pr-readiness` to run local CodeRabbit review:

    ```bash
    coderabbit review --agent --uncommitted --include-untracked
    ```

13. Fix actionable findings, rerun validation, and repeat local review until
    clean or every remaining item has a documented reason.
14. Commit the focused change, push it, and open or update a pull request by
    default after meaningful work.
15. Require CI validation, applicable security checks, CodeRabbit review, and a
    fresh independent review on the latest commit.
16. Fix or explain every review item, resolve completed threads, and repeat the
    checks after every push.
17. Complete and document required manual testing on the real target
    environment.
18. Merge only after the final diff, planning documents, CI, security checks,
    reviews, threads, and manual tests are clean.

## Pull requests by default

Unless the user says not to, work on a feature branch, keep it synced with the
base branch, open or update a PR after meaningful pushes, and resolve merge
conflicts on the branch until the PR is mergeable.

## Blocked by keys or auth

If work depends on a missing secret, login, 2FA, or dashboard permission:

1. Stop. Do not invent degrading workarounds.
2. Ask for the exact human action or credential needed.
3. Wait before expensive paid builds, store submits, or production deploys.

## Security baseline

Establish the security checks that apply to the repository instead of adding
irrelevant gates:

- Enable secret scanning and push protection where available.
- Configure Dependabot for every package ecosystem and GitHub Actions.
- Run dependency review when dependency manifests can change.
- Configure CodeQL for every language in the repository that CodeQL supports.
- Document accepted exceptions with a reason, owner, and review date.
- Never commit secret values; STATUS secret inventories list locations only.

## Required pull request evidence

Record the problem, approach, important decisions, exact automated checks,
manual tests, screenshots for visible changes, limitations, skipped validation,
and follow-up work.

## Documentation rule

Do not rely on a coding agent discovering arbitrary documents by filename.
Reference supporting documents from `AGENTS.md`, a selected skill, or the task
prompt. Keep the specification, roadmap, tasks, status, and implementation
synchronized when requirements or architecture change.
